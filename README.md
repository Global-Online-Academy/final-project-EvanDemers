#FINAL PROJECT!
---
Hello! This project set out to answer the question
*"Do lower working hours increase happiness and productivity in a way that is mutually beneficial for the worker and business?"*
This was done by sourcing data from 4 different databases.
I then put that data into four different scatter plots to graph the data. This was done with the Bokeh package, a powerful graphing tool.
The programs here are quite messy. Each database has a program to collect the data from it, with some extra programs to parse two types of data together. On top of that, each of the four graphs has its own program, with the final MAIN.py program to collect and plot all of them together.
To see the results, look [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16GZh9aSwRDO62dN87vT0B9rBoqPZFbu47wvBR9xU3KI/edit?usp=sharing)
I had a lot of fun in this project, and found some interesting results. Let me know what you think!
